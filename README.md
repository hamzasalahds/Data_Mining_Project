# DSC 550 Data Mining Project

## Overview
This project is part of the DSC 550 Data Mining course. Its objective is to apply various data mining techniques, such as classification, clustering, or regression, to a real-world dataset. The project explores different approaches to data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation.
